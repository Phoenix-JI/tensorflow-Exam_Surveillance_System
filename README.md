## The exam surveillance system to detect the cheating behaviours
During the Covid-19 outbreak, we have to conduct the online exams. In order to keep fairness, I plan to develop the exam surveillance system to detect the cheating behaviours and four cases will be detected in my system including people counting, mouth opening, eyes movement, and cell phone detection.

The key point is to apply the facial landmark by Dlib and the YOLO v3 as the object detection algorithm.
